      <p>Here’s a story I’ve heard at least a hundred times:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“So I signed up for an online course. They had a lot of short videos, then quizzes and code challenges to test my understanding. I got pretty far. It was very informative and the videos were well done. But then I sat down at my computer to build an idea I had and… I still didn’t know where to even start. I feel like I should know, but I don’t.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So why does this keep happening? How can people feel like they learned a lot, but still not be able to use what they learned? One reason is overused abstractions.</p>
<h2 id="The-danger-of-abstractions"><a href="#The-danger-of-abstractions" class="headerlink" title="The danger of abstractions"></a>The danger of abstractions</h2><p>First, let me explain the term. Imagine I want to teach you to ride a horse. The problem is, horses are expensive. So I have you just sit in a saddle – well, not a real saddle – it’s actually just a regular chair. Go find a regular chair at home and sit in it. But imagine it’s a saddle. And I’ll explain how to use the reins to steer. Pull them to the right to go right, then to the left to go left. For the reins, you can take some rope at home and tie it to another chair. Then to make the horse go faster, kick its haunches. Go ahead and kick the legs of your chair now. Now when the horse is at a trot, kind of push yourself up and down, rhythmically with the horse. Your chair won’t be moving rhythmically, but… uh, imagine it is.</p>
<p>OK, so those are the basics. Now you know how to ride a horse, right? Sadly, no. We’ve replaced actually riding the horse with too many abstractions. These abstractions do have benefits. You don’t have to pay to ride an actual horse and you can practice from home. That’d be great, if the tradeoff didn’t result in exercises that are in fact, very little like riding a real horse.</p>
<p>Maybe we are a little more prepared for the real horse, but it’s still time wasted, because if you had just gotten on a horse in the first place, you could have learned more in 5 minutes than 10 hours on that chair. In fact, some differences between the chair and the horse may have even made you learn the wrong things. Stuff you’ll have to unlearn once you get on the real horse.</p>
<p><img src="http://img.picturequotes.com/2/13/12577/in-theory-there-is-no-difference-between-theory-and-practice-in-practice-there-is-quote-1.jpg" alt="In theory, there is no difference between theory in practice. In practice, there is."></p>
<p>Similarly, typing code into a box on a website is so abstracted from the actual work, processes, and tools of professional developers, that it’s often possible to master every course they offer and still have never built a real thing, from scratch. You have nothing to show for your time other than colorful badges.</p>
<h2 id="How-we-avoid-abstractions"><a href="#How-we-avoid-abstractions" class="headerlink" title="How we avoid abstractions"></a>How we avoid abstractions</h2><p>In every single Code Lab lesson – even the first one – students build a real website (and eventually webapp) and launch it, live to the Internet. They use the same tools that professionals do to write their code, test that it works, share their code and get feedback on it, then finally host it so that others can see the fruits of their labor.</p>
<p>And each lesson is designed to take about an hour and a half to complete, so that students can practice this process over and over again. They get to know the tricks. By doing, they slowly develop an appreciation for why we use these tools – how they make our work easier.</p>
<p>It’s more intimidating at first than an abstraction. Just like it’s easier to get on a chair than the horse. The horse could throw you. Heck, at some point, it probably will throw you. But with compassionate and experienced professionals around to help you land safely, you’ll be OK.</p>
<p>And you’ll know what you can build, because look, there – you built it. You wrote every line, organized every file, ran every command. And now it’s out there. You’ve joined the ranks of people who build the Internet. And it feels better than any badge.</p>
